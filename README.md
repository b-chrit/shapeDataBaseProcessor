# Shape Database Processor

This Python project is a shape database processor implemented as part of COMP 348 - Principles of Programming Languages.

## Description

The Shape Database Processor is an interactive Python application designed to read, process, and analyze shape databases. The supported shapes include Circle, Ellipse, and Rhombus. The program provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to load shape data, perform operations, and obtain insights into the shape collection.

## Features

- Load shape databases from text files.
- Convert the collection to a set to remove duplicates.
- Save collections to files.
- Print shape information to the console.
- Display summary and detailed statistics of the shapes.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/b-chrit/shapeDataBaseProcessor.git
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Navigate to the repository directory.
4. Place your shape database text file in the same directory.
5. Open your terminal and run the following command:
